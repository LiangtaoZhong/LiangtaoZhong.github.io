Multi-rotor UAV has been widely studied and applied in academia and industry in recent years due to its simple structure, strong maneuverability, vertical take-off and landing and fixed-point hovering ability. Due to the ability to obtain more accurate positioning information through Global Navigation Satellite System, multi-rotor UAV has made rapid progress in the fields of power inspection, aerial photography, and express delivery. However, for GNSS-limited scenarios, the auton¬omous flight capability of multi-rotor UAV still needs to be further improved. In recent years, with the rapid development of machine vision technology, it is possible for UAV to use low-cost vision sensors to fly autonomously in GNSS-limited scenes. In this thesis, the key technologies of autonomous flight for vision driven multi-rotor UAV are studied.
